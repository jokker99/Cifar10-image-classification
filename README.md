# Cifar10-image-classification
Image classification using CNN
   created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras with a TensorFlow backend, and trained CNNs to solve Image             
   Classification problems. In this project, I created and train a CNN model on a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.
